In October 2018 I have finally pulled the trigger and ordered a Van's RV-14 empennage and wings kit.

## The Mission

I want to build a plane. And when it's finished I want to fly it.

There are a few demands my airplane has to satisfy:

1. Have enough room for two persons - no matter small or large
2. Cross Country capability
3. Light aerobatics capability
4. Doesn't look ugly and makes fun
5. \(IFR certified\)

#### Two Seater

I am seldomly going to fly with more than one passenger. And when I do, the pax in the backseat does not really increase the fun of flying. So for me as a pilot it does not really matter if I have one or two or three passengers. So I'll go with a two-seater - it's less expensive and more dynamic than a four seater.

Also I really like interacting with my pax/co-pilot. The best way I can do that is when the pax is sitting right next to me and I can look into her/his face, show some details on the instruments etc. That's why I do not want to go with a tandem seating configuration.

#### Cross Country

In 2018 I have had my best holidays yet. It was a flight from Augsburg \(southern Germany\) over the Alps to Florence \(Italy\), to Elba \(Italy\) to Corse \(France\) and back. We have stayed at AirBnB rooms and spent the day eating, drinking, sleeping and flying. I want to build a plane that it suitable to do lots more of those trips!

#### Aerobatics

You cannot do good aerobatics with a plane that is somehow suitable to do cross country. But there are planes that allow to do a little bit of aerodynamics while being suitable to cross country! Some loops, rolls, cubans, something like that. I think that would be a lot of fun when you take some friends to go flying or just do some light aerobatics during sun set. The RV-14 is a good fit for that. For more acro I probably will need to build a Pitt's or an MX2.

#### Fun to fly

I want to have a plane that is fun to fly. On the ground \(tail wheel\) and in the air \("RV grin"\). So the RV is a good choice, isn't it?

#### IFR

I really like all those procedures that come with instruments flying. Until now I have not made an instrument rating but I am planning to do so. In Germany IFR certified experimentals currently do not exist. There are a few hurdles to take for an IFR certification: The aeromechanics have to fulfill certain stability requirements; the engine and prop have to be certified; additionally you need fail safe IFR ready avionics. Fail safe means that one component may fail without leading to a fatal incident.

When building my plane I want to keep the option open to certify the aircraft for IFR. The RV-14 looks like a suitably platform for a two-person IFR aircraft.

I will describe the whole IFR topic in more detail in the "General Thoughts" section of this documentation, as soon as I have done some progress on the building and am thinking about engine, prop and avionics.
