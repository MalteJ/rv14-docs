# Vertical Stabilizer

The first step in building the RV-14 is making the vertical stabilizer. That means clecoing everything together, final drill the holes, uncleco everything, deburring, dimpling, recleco and then riveting.

During riveting the flush rivets on the skin I have learned it is a good idea to cover the area where the rivet gun hits the skin with tape. Otherwise you see marks on the skin afterwards. This is not a critical issue. It's more a cosmetic thing as the skins will be scuffed for painting in the end. But during the building your skins looks nicer which contributes to the builder's happiness ;-\)
