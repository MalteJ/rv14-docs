# Corrosion Protection

#### Why I do not prime

Corrosion protection is a hot topic in the airplane builder scene. Especially when you operate your plane in salty air or you do not have a hangar space you should care about corrosion protection. As I am based in Munich, Germany, my RV-14 will not get lots of contact with salty air. Also I am going to store the plane in a hangar. The expected air time will not be more than a few hundred hours per year. So even without advanced corrosion protection my RV-14 should not get corrosion problems for a very long time.

The RV-14 is, like all Van's Aircraft models, a full aluminum construction. The aluminum alloy 2024 with an alclad finish is used for all aluminum parts. "_2024 aluminium alloy is an aluminium alloy, with copper as the primary alloying element. It is used in applications requiring high strength to weight ratio, as well as good fatigue resistance. It is weldable only through friction welding, and has average machinability. Due to poor corrosion resistance, it is often clad with aluminium or Al-1Zn for protection, although this may reduce the fatigue strength._" \([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2024_aluminium_alloy)\)

Aluminum is a chemically very reactive metal. When it gets in contact with oxygen it reacts to aluminum hydroxide that itself protects underlying aluminium layers from corrosion. The alclad finish is a pure aluminum coating that is meant to be oxydized and protecting the alloy below.  This works really well until there are penetrating damages to the alclad coating \(scratches\).

Another common way in the aerospace industry to protect against corrosion is priming. For this the aluminum hydroxide layer is scuffed of the aluminum sheets, oil and fat is removed using aceton, the parts will get rinsed and afterwards primed with a two component aluminum primer. Primed parts have a better corrosion protection than alclad coated aluminum. Smaller scratches are only scratches in the primer and do not affect the aluminum. But priming adds multiple kilograms of weight to the aircraft. And it is a lot of work to thoroughly prime all your aircraft parts.

In the end I have decided against priming. Reason number one: My aircraft is not very prone to corrosion due to my mission definition. Reason number two: It is a f\*\*\*\* lot of work to prime everything. Reason number three: The aluminum parts have alclad coating and thereby a basic corrosion protection from the beginning. In the end there are currently no RVs known to be affected by heavy corrosion. So I'll give it a shot!
