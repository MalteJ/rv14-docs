# Wings

My wings build kit will be loaded onto the QUEBEC EXPRESS and will leave Quebec for Hamburg on Feb. 1st, 2019. The vessel's position can be tracked via [https://www.vesselfinder.com/de/?imo=9294836](https://www.vesselfinder.com/de/?imo=9294836) as long as the vessel is near a radio receiver on land. Expected arrival in Hamburg is Feb 16th.
